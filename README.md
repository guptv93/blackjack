# Blackjack Reinforcement Learning Agent and Cognitive Modelling

Here we have first developed a Reinforcement Learning Agent to come up with the optimal BlackJack strategy. Then we have created a web-app to collect data on how human players choose actions in Blackjack. The final paper analyzes how well humans simulate the optimal strategy and also compares it to some other heuristics.
